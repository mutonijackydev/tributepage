            <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
            <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li> <strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li ><strong>1933</strong>  - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br> to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li ><strong>1935</strong>  - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
            <li ><strong>1937</strong>  - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
            <li ><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
            <li ><strong>1941</strong>  - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
            <li ><strong>1942</strong> -  - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <li ><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br>resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
            <li ><strong>1945</strong>  - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat<br> yields</li>
            <li ><strong>1953</strong>   - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li ><strong>1962</strong>  - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br>subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population</li>
            <li ><strong>1970</strong>  receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li ><strong>1983</strong>  1983</span> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br> sorghum yields</li>
            <li ><strong>1984</strong>  - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <li ><strong>2005</strong>  - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br>because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br>time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
            <li ><strong>2009</strong>  - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>
